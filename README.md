'animate.js' creates and exports a function 'animate' which performs a JavaScript animation. It accepts two parameters: 1) 'animationF', which is a callback that is exectured during each cycle of the animation, and 2) 'duration', which specifies how long in ms the animation lasts. The 'animate' function returns a promise that resolves when the animation duration has expired. 'requestAnimationFrame' is used to time the cycling of the animation.
